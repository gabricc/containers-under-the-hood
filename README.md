To get started with this project make sure you have [vagrant](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/install?product_intent=vagrant) and [virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) installed in your machines, then run: `vagrant up`. 

Then go through the .md files following the numerical order.

In the end you should be able to run a container without using a container runtime.
